They make struggle to produce a CV using word-processing or fill-in an online application for a job or a benefit. They may never have bought anything on-line despite the fact that the savings made could be really useful for them. In other areas there are Coffee 'n Computers projects where people can drop in to get the help they need (and a quick refreshment). Each project needs a leader and a small team of volunteers to provide the help that it needed. Here in Burnt Oak we need to find that volunteer for the leadership role. We don't have a detailed list of what you WILL do. However it is easy to say what you WON'T do. You are not here to fix people's broken technology but to help them make best use of whatever is in their hand, be it PC, SMART phone or something else. A simple example might be that a person acquires some new equipment (e.g. laptop) and just needs someone to shop them how to use it.     ",
