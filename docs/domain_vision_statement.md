The model can represent Organisations in a specific geographical area.  
Users can administrate Organisations which allows them to edit data 
associated with the Organisation, and create (delete, and restore) 
Volunteer Opportunities specific to that Organisation.  Users can claim 
administrative rights on an Organisation which are then approved or 
declined by a SuperAdmin user.

The SuperAdmin user has the ability to edit data associated with any 
Organisation and also delete and restore organisations.  The SuperAdmin 
can also invite new Users for those Organisations that do not yet have 
an administrator.

There is a SiteAdmin that is able to propose (?) edits to all organisations.

The Model should support different views and search on the Organisations 
and the Volunteer Opportunities to allow all Users and Guests to discover 
items of interest.
