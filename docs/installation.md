## Installation

Instructions for installation on different OSs:

* [OSX](installation/osx.md)
* [Linux](installation/linux.md)
* [C9](installation/c9.md)

If you're on Windows, our condolences.  [C9](https://c9.io/) is probably your best option.

We also have some collected notes on [issues encountered during install](installation/issues.md)

[Feature flags](https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/wiki/Feature-flags), are automatically activated when you run ```rake db:seed```.
