LocalSupport
============

LocalSupport is the software that runs the [Harrow Community Network](https://www.harrowcn.org.uk/), which was originally conceived as a directory of local support services, e.g. a list charities and non-profits in a particular area.  It's since pivoted to focus on volunteer opportunities in a local area, but the list of organisations remains accessible.
