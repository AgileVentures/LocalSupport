        on Portobello Road in central London. We offer one to one individual counselling
        to a wide range of people over the age of 18.\nWe can be accessed by anyone
        residing in the Greater London area.\nIf you would like to register for an
        appointment, please call between 10am and 5.30pm on weekdays.\nWhen you refer
        yourself to Help Counselling, we will take some details, including your name,
        contact number, and times when you\u2019re available to attend, as well as
        asking you a few questions about your mental health history.\nThe more flexible
        you can be in terms of your availability, the quicker we can usually offer
        a session. There tends to be a longer wait for evening sessions. Sessions
        are available Monday to Friday from 10am, with final sessions at 7:30pm (8:30pm
        on Thursdays). We also have sessions on Saturday from 11am, with final sessions
        at 2pm.\nIf your mental health history seems very complex, we will most likely
        consider it in your best interests to seek counselling with a qualified therapist.
        If this is the case, we will suggest other services that provide such support.\nIf
        you are offered therapy at Help, your first appointment will be an initial
        assessment. This provides an opportunity to meet with your counsellor and
        discuss what you are seeking counselling for. If after the initial assessment
        both you and the counsellor are happy to work together, then you\u2019ll sign
        an initial contract for 6 sessions. There may be the possibility to extend
        following a review. Your appointment will take place at the same time, on
        the same day, each week.\n","OfficeMain-Phone-General Phone":"020 7221 9974","OfficeMain-Email":"info@helpcounsellingcentre.com","Website":"https://www.helpcounselling.com/","Delivered

        is a physiotherapy led rehabilitation project, consisting of a weekly evidence-based

        core ethos is that our sessions are open to all individuals regardless of
        income, address or level of disability (as long as they can be safely accommodated
        in the group). We only charge a small fee to attend (which we have found facilitates
        adherence to the programme and contributes to people''s empowerment), so our
        costs are subsidised by our fundraising efforts and we achieved UK Registered
        Charity Status in March 2018 (Charity Number 1177659). By becoming a Charity,
        as opposed to a clinically commissioned service, we are free to provide the
        service we feel is most effective, to as many as people as we can and we have
        always co-developed the service in response to feedback from our participants
        and the best clinical evidence we can find. We have 4 trustees responsible
        for the Charity, including our Physiotherapist and Founder who also operates
