        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue is an outreach team working with rough sleeper across 14 boroughs
        of London and is part of the homeless charity Thames Reach.\n\nEvery night
        of the year, London Street Rescue are out and about across London, acting
        as a safety net for some of society\u2019s most vulnerable men and women.
        Our team of outreach workers and volunteers find and engage with rough sleepers
        to help them off the streets. \n\nLondon Street Rescue support rough sleepers
        of all ages and with many different needs including those who are coping with
        poor mental health, poor physical health or living with drug or alcohol addictions.
        \n\nGetting rough sleepers into accommodation is often the first step towards
        them getting back on track and having a home of their own. \n\nLondon Street
        Rescue refuse to give up on people. Staff work with individuals for as long
        as it takes to help them move away from a street lifestyle, no matter how
        complex their needs. \n\nPeople sleeping rough are very vulnerable to the
        dangers of the streets. The actions of London Street Rescue can save lives.","charity":true,"city":"LONDON","contact_name":"Zsofia

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        Street Rescue are now recruiting for volunteers for north, west and east London.
        We would particularly like to hear from you if you live near Hillingdon, Haringey
        or Newham. If you would like to volunteer your time, please refer to what
        to expect on a typical shift below.\n\nWhat to expect: Each shift varies but
        you would be advised to wear something comfortable and warm; much of the shift
        will be on the street either looking for or talking to a rough sleeper. Outreach
        workers go out in all weather conditions. You will be accompanying an experienced
        outreach worker on a full outreach shift acting as a front-line worker.\nYou
        will take your lead from your outreach worker. Most of the time you will be
        involved in what they do but there might be occasions for reasons of confidentiality
        that they ask you to step back a bit, please don\u2019t be offended. Generally,
        there is very little risk associated with the shifts, mainly because the people
        you meet are more vulnerable than aggressive but also because we have a robust
        risk management process; BUT it is important that you follow what your outreach
        worker tells you, a risky situation can be created inadvertently by a slip
        of the tongue or misconstrued look. \n\nPick up: You will be picked up by
        an outreach worker from your home address or arrange a place to meet in the
        area you will be working in. You will be dropped off at your home address
        by car or taxi at the end of the shift.\n\nShift times: Shifts start at around
        8-9pm and finish at around 1-2am the following morning. On a very rare occasion
        the volunteer shift might run slightly later if we find a client who needs
        to be taken to an assessment centre. \n\nFinally, for health and safety reasons
        all shifts require two people to be out on shift at all times; an outreach
        worker is not be allowed to go on shift by themselves. Therefore, if you cancel
        your shift at short notice, the whole shift will have to be cancelled. This
        not only impacts on the people sleeping rough who need our service but also
        the reputation of Thames Reach as a whole. So we urge all of our volunteers
        if possible to try to avoid cancelling once the shift has been arranged.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"6

        of the year, London Street Rescue are out and about across London, acting
        as a safety net for some of society\u2019s most vulnerable men and women.
        Our team of outreach workers and volunteers find and engage with rough sleepers
        to help them off the streets. \n\nLondon Street Rescue support rough sleepers
        of all ages and with many different needs including those who are coping with
        poor mental health, poor physical health or living with drug or alcohol addictions.
        \n\nGetting rough sleepers into accommodation is often the first step towards
        them getting back on track and having a home of their own. \n\nLondon Street
        Rescue refuse to give up on people. Staff work with individuals for as long
        as it takes to help them move away from a street lifestyle, no matter how
        complex their needs. \n\nPeople sleeping rough are very vulnerable to the
        dangers of the streets. The actions of London Street Rescue can save lives.","charity":true,"city":"LONDON","contact_name":"Zsofia

        lack of confidence, structure and social support. \n\nTaking up a new hobby
        or activity allows people struggling with these barriers to develop not only
        a new skill, but also to gain a routine, meet new people and improve their
        confidence. All of this enables clients to not only improve their employability,
        but also their quality of life. \n\nWe would love to hear from anyone who
        has a passion for an accessible art or craft activity that they would like
        to share with our clients. The main duty of this volunteer role would be to
        lead and share an activity on an on-going basis with a group of Shaw Trust\u2019s

        you believe that everyone who wants to work deserves equal opportunities to
        do so? Could you empower someone with additional support needs to participate
        in one of Scope\u2019s employment services? If so, this could be the role
        for you.\n\nAbout Kickstart\nKickstart is Scope\u2019s employment service
        which supports working age disabled people who want to enter or return to
        the workplace to find, apply for and keep a job. The individually tailored
        service operates in an inclusive, friendly and professional environment to
        prepare each customer for paid employment, volunteering, or further work or
        training opportunities within the local community. Specialist employment advisers
        work with every customer to help achieve their career goals by providing disabled
        people with bespoke advice and guidance, employability workshops, employment
        taster sessions, valuable work experience, interview preparation skills, and
        employment and training opportunities. \n\nMain purpose of the role \nIn this
        volunteer role as Volunteer Employment Support Assistant, you would be closely
        supporting the local employment advisers to offer either one to one or group
        support to customers that may fit our additional requirements. Your role would
        involve providing regular ad-hoc support to your allocated customer(s). Typical
        support may include interpretation (for example; BSL), literacy, job search
        and completing application forms, cover letters and engaging with customers
        to prepare them for both mock and work based interviews. The role is initially
        available on an ad-hoc basis as customers will be given the option to opt
        in or out of this additional support.\n\nRange of tasks to be carried out\n\u2022\tAssisting
        customers to undertake regular (possibly weekly) job searches \u2013 this
        could be internet based, phone based or from local press.\n\u2022\tSupporting
        customers to complete application forms for paid, volunteer or work experience
        opportunities.\n\u2022\tCarrying out mock interview practice with customers
        for paid, volunteer or work experience opportunities.\n\u2022\tHelping to
        instil a sense of belief and confidence in our customers by supporting them
        to see their potential, and ultimately gain employment.\n\u2022\tMeeting additional
        support needs that customers have to enable them to access our employment
        service \u2013 for example, this could include interpreting for someone who
        uses British Sign Language (BSL)\n\u2022\tCarrying out all of the above tasks
        with instruction and support from Scope\u2019s employment advisers.\n\nHow
        we will support you (including reasonable adjustments)\n\u2022\tVolunteer
        induction into Scope\n\u2022\tRelevant training (to be discussed on an individual
        basis)\n\u2022\tRegular meetings with your volunteer manager. \n\u2022\tWe

        you live anywhere in Harrow or near by, we would like to hear from you. We

        for more information or call direct on 0207 833 6740 \n\nWe are looking for
        adult (18+) volunteers who will visit a child or young person in foster care
        or living in a residential children''s home. Volunteer independent visitors
        are there to ''assist, befriend and advise'' and be a person in their lives
        who is separate from social services, and who spend time with the young person
        because they choose to. \n\nWe\u2019re delivering the Independent Visitor
        Service across Harrow. We match each volunteer independent visitor with a
        child or young person who needs extra support and encouragement, sometimes
        because they have little or no contact with their own families. \n\nThe volunteer
        is there as someone \u2018independent\u2019 in the young person\u2019s life,
        distinct from the professionals paid to support them. They might take the
        young person to the cinema or to the park, encourage them to try a new sport
        or hobby, support them at meetings or simply be there to talk to. It makes
        a real difference to a young person to know they have someone who is on their
        side, who has chosen to be there for them.\nAll of our volunteers are fully
        trained and supported and are asked to meet with their young person once a
        month for a couple of hours.\nWe normally ask for a minimum commitment for
        18 months to make a useful contribution to a young person''s life. There are
        opportunities throughout the week to volunteer on this project but, it is
        predominantly at the weekends.\n\nhttp://www.sova.org.uk/project/HarrowIV","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":67,"address_1":"5th
