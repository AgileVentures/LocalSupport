        help with training sessions and with developing our teaching materials.\n\nBy

        work  one-to-one with year-2 and year-3 children to help improve their maths

        and skills to support these volunteers.\n\nMentors can choose to support a
        smaller or larger number of volunteers; you can select your commitment to
        fit the time you wish to give.  \n\nOur mentors observe one-to-one sessions
        in schools and give feedback  to the volunteers, and give the volunteers support
        and direction when they have specific questions.  Optionally, they may also
        help with training sessions and with developing our teaching materials.\n\nBy
        helping our in-school volunteers, our mentors contribute to supporting the
        education of young children who are falling behind.  The role will also assist
        them in maintaining their professional skills and contacts. Number Sense is

        you live in London and would be willing to travel to Harrow (or surrounding
        areas), we would like to hear from you. We need volunteers who will visit
        a young person living in care once a month. Full training provided\n\nWe are
        looking for adult (18+) volunteers who will visit a child or young person
        in foster care or living in a residential children''s home. Volunteer independent
        visitors are there to ''assist, befriend and advise'' and be a person in their
        lives who is separate from social services, and who spend time with the young
        person because they choose to. \n\nWe\u2019re delivering the Independent Visitor
        Service across Harrow. We match each volunteer independent visitor with a
        child or young person who needs extra support and encouragement, sometimes
        because they have little or no contact with their own families. \n\nThe volunteer
        is there as someone independent in the young person\u2019s life, distinct
        from the professionals paid to support them. They might take the young person
        to the cinema or to the park, encourage them to try a new sport or hobby,
        support them at meetings or simply be there to talk to. It makes a real difference
        to a young person to know they have someone who is on their side, who has
        chosen to be there for them.\n\nAll of our volunteers are fully trained and
        supported and are asked to meet with their young person once a month for a
        couple of hours.We normally ask for a minimum commitment for 18 months to
        make a useful contribution to a young person''s life. There are opportunities
        throughout the week to volunteer on this project but it is predominantly at
        the weekends.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":92,"address_1":"5th

        you live in London and would be willing to travel to Harrow (or surrounding
        areas), we would like to hear from you. We need volunteers who will visit
        a young person living in care once a month. Full training provided\n\nWe are
        looking for adult (18+) volunteers who will visit a child or young person
        in foster care or living in a residential children''s home. Volunteer independent
        visitors are there to ''assist, befriend and advise'' and be a person in their
        lives who is separate from social services, and who spend time with the young
        person because they choose to. \n\nWe\u2019re delivering the Independent Visitor
        Service across Harrow. We match each volunteer independent visitor with a
        child or young person who needs extra support and encouragement, sometimes
        because they have little or no contact with their own families. \n\nThe volunteer
        is there as someone independent in the young person\u2019s life, distinct
        from the professionals paid to support them. They might take the young person
        to the cinema or to the park, encourage them to try a new sport or hobby,
        support them at meetings or simply be there to talk to. It makes a real difference
        to a young person to know they have someone who is on their side, who has
        chosen to be there for them.\n\nAll of our volunteers are fully trained and
        supported and are asked to meet with their young person once a month for a
        couple of hours.We normally ask for a minimum commitment for 18 months to

        Change, Grow, Live (CGL) - Community Volunteering \n \nWe are a social care
        and health charity that supports and enables people to change their lives

        users are adults, young people and families whose lives are affected by substance
        misuse, homelessness, poverty, unemployment, domestic abuse, mental health

        their lives, grow as a person and live life to its full potential.\n\nWe fundamentally
        believe that everyone has the potential to change and that everyone deserves,

        to their own success.\n\nWe are driven by a belief in social justice and are
        passionate about creating opportunities for all our service users to make
        positive improvements to their lives. We respect our service users and support
        their right to self-determination and independence.\n\nAs a charity, our aim
        is to make our expertise available to as many individuals and communities

        ever, we\u2019re looking for a whole range of Santa\u2019s little helpers
        (otherwise known as volunteers!) to support our events and, of course, join
        in the celebrations.\n\nOur doors are not only open to individuals, groups
        of families and friends are also welcome. We know that volunteering has no
        age barrier and would love to see our neighbours of all ages join in the festive
        fun.\n\nRoles may include:\nLaughing, chatting and the odd \u2018Ho,ho,ho!\u2019
        \nBringing the X-factor to our carol sing along \nBeing ready to lose at board
        games \nGetting covered in glue and glitter during crafts \nServing mince

        amazing team of vibrant & diverse volunteers helps us run over 700 shops.
        Our stores sell lots of great donated & new goods to help raise vital funds

        across the UK.\n\nOur retail stores are the face of our charity on the high-street
        and in local communities. We have loads of amazing stock donated to us every
        week, and this all needs to be sorted, tagged and put on the shop-floor for
        sale!\n\nMaking sure our shops look fantastic is another task you can get
        involved with. You may also be required to help out on the till too, but we
        will show you how that works during your time volunteering with us. We value
        the contribution of everyone who supports Barnardo\u2019s.\n\nYou will be
        a friendly face of Barnardo\u2019s by volunteering in one of our shops. It
        would be great if you could volunteer one shift a week (or even more if you
        want) but we\u2019re always happy to be flexible to work around your availability.\n\nWhat''s
        in it for you\n-Have fun and meet new people\n-Develop skills for your CV
        including confidence, teamwork and problem solving\n-Make a difference to
        the lives of children, young people and their families\n-Learning and development
