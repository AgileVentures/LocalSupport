        a producer is a great chance to gain new skills and experience in event management,
        in everything from event design, to marketing and liaison to front of house.\nYou
        can work towards Arts Awards too, which is nationally recognised qualification.\n\nWe
        meet every thursday from 5.30 and 7pm to plan and organize events.\n\n\nMost
        of our events take place on Saturdays. You can see photos on \n\nwww.fb.com/hacguestlistPart-time.",

        and enthusiastic individuals throughout the UK to recruit, motivate and co-ordinate
        fundraising groups for Make-A-Wish.\n\nYou''ll need to organise at least one
        fundraising event and street collection per year. You''ll be based in your
        local area, and the amount of time you spend with your fundraising group will
        depend on the number of people you recruit. We''d like you to commit to this
        role for a minimum of a year \u2013 and ideally longer.\n\nWhat will I be
        doing?\n\nAs group leader your role will be to recruit group members from
        within your networks and relationships across the community and inspire them
        to fundraise for Make-A-Wish. As a team we would ideally like you to fulfil
        a number of objectives:\n1.Organise at least one fundraising event per year.
        This could be a coffee morning, or something as grand as a village fete. Focus
        on the skills of the group and what you like doing and go from there.\n2.Organise
        one charity street collection per year. This could be a day outside a supermarket
        collecting or, if you have enough volunteers, covering a whole city or borough
        \u2013 it\u2019s up to you. We\u2019ve put together a \u2018How To\u2019 guide
        for collections with all you need to know about putting a collection day together.\n3.Hold
        a Make-A-Wish stall at local Fairs or open days. We do not have merchandise
        to sell, but if you can think of a fun fundraising stand like a teddy tombola
        or lucky dip to attract people to your stall, this would be great and would
        help us raise awareness of Make-A-Wish in your local area.\n4.Help promote
        local fundraising activity and campaigns in the local area.\n5.Represent the
        charity at local events and cheque presentations as requested.\n6.Keep the
        Fundraising Team updated with any new talks that are generated through the
        project\u2019s activity.\n7.Approach local businesses that may be able to
        hold a collecting tin, display a poster, hold a small fundraising event for
        Make-A-Wish.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": null, "created": "2014-10-27T18:37:42.730287+00:00",

        are always on the look- out for people to join the committee. We meet once-a-month

        who can help at the club nights, assist the athletics group when they have
        a sports meeting or being on stand-by when we need to make repairs to the
        building or step-in to take the place of a regular volunteer who is temporarily
        unavailable. \n\nAll persons who deal with any member with a learning disability

        qualifications. Horsesmouth is not a professional advisory service. What it
        is, however, is a sounding board for those occasions in life when people really
        want to talk to someone who''s been there and done that.\r\n\r\nSo, if you
        have some time to spare (10 minutes or 10 hours) you can help support and
        inspire others by registering as a mentor. From starting a business to starting
        a family; from life with cancer to life as a carer; from which A level, NVQ
        or undergraduate course to whether an MBA; someone needs what you know.",

        "No specific times. Approximately 4 hours per week minimum.\n\nMembers of
        the warden team take time getting to know the site and then take responsibility
        for its management and for interaction with the public. \nCollectively the
        warden team, together with the Biodiversity Officer and the Public Realm manager
        from Harrow Council, and Natural England, English Heritage and other external
        bodies, create the strategy for managing Pear Wood. Management has two strands,
        maintenance of the present ecological structure (for example, by strimming
        Grim''s Dyke to prevent growth of trees whose roots would damage to the ancient
        structure) and carefully planned improvements. In particular, active management
        of the Southern Wood Ant population includes transfer of populations from
        nearby sites that are under threat from development, together with the creation
        of the sunlit glades preferred by this species. \n\nSpecific roles and responsibilities
        include: \n\n- Spending time on the site, getting to know the paths, plants
        and animals. \n- Low scale maintenance of the site such as picking up litter
        and cutting \nback branches that are impeding paths. \n- Participation in
        the creation of management plans. \n- Supervision of volunteer working parties.
        Volunteers from the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers (BTCV) perform
        jobs such as scrub clearance and fence building. They are accompanied by a
        supervisor \nwho is responsible for safety, transport and refreshments, so
        the warden''s role is specifically to supervise the work done.  \n- Contact
        with the public. Wardens should talk to members of the public about the site
        and distribute leaflets. They should encourage good behaviour and, where possible
        and safe, discourage bad behaviour such \nas lighting fires or damaging the
        ant nests. Where direct intervention would be unsafe, wardens should call
        from help from the Cannons Safer Neighbourhoods Police Team or, for immediate
        help, call 999.", "for_recruiter": {"contact_name": "Ramesh perinparaja",

        "HAC Ambassadors are local people with a passion for the arts, who help Harrow
        Arts Centre make sure it is reaching out to all communities in Harrow. Ambassadors
        help us find out what local people would like to see and do here, help us
        make links with local community groups and get involved in helping us run
        our events. This is a crucial role that helps us ensure HAC is open and reaching
        out to members of all community groups, ages and locations in our borough.
        \n\nEach Ambassador role is tailored the individual, and the idea is that
        the role should fit within your everyday routine. You might choose to represent
        your local geographical area, like your road or estate, or a cultural group
        you belong to. It\u2019s a very friendly group and everyone is welcome. \n\nActivities
        Ambassadors have been undertaking recently include:\n* Supporting performance
        events in Harrow shopping centres and speaking to the public\n* Distributing
        fliers and brochures on our events in their local area or through the groups
        they belong to\n* Getting feedback from friends and family on our programme,
        building and experience of visiting us\n* Finding new opportunities for us
        to advertise our work including local shops, speaking at events on our behalf,
        online\n* Helping to plan our Family Fun Day and Open Evening events\n\nWe
        offer a range of benefits for Ambassadors including a free ticket allocation.",

        stock for the shop floor. \r\nSorting and organising stock in the stockroom
        so that the area is kept in order. \r\nWorking behind the scenes to help to
        hang, size, steam and price stock. \r\nMaking sure all stock is safe and in
        working order.\r\n\r\nWe will provide you with all the support you need to
        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store
        manager and the rest of the team. Volunteering in a Barnardo''s charity shop

        you believe that everyone who wants to work deserves equal opportunities to
        do so? Could you empower someone with additional support needs to participate
        in one of Scope\u2019s employment services? If so, this could be the role
        for you.\n\nAbout Kickstart\nKickstart is Scope\u2019s employment service
        which supports working age disabled people who want to enter or return to
        the workplace to find, apply for and keep a job. The individually tailored
        service operates in an inclusive, friendly and professional environment to
        prepare each customer for paid employment, volunteering, or further work or
        training opportunities within the local community. Specialist employment advisers
        work with every customer to help achieve their career goals by providing disabled
        people with bespoke advice and guidance, employability workshops, employment
        taster sessions, valuable work experience, interview preparation skills, and
        employment and training opportunities. \n\nMain purpose of the role \nIn this
        volunteer role as Volunteer Employment Support Assistant, you would be closely
        supporting the local employment advisers to offer either one to one or group
        support to customers that may fit our additional requirements. Your role would
        involve providing regular ad-hoc support to your allocated customer(s). Typical
        support may include interpretation (for example; BSL), literacy, job search
        and completing application forms, cover letters and engaging with customers
        to prepare them for both mock and work based interviews. The role is initially
        available on an ad-hoc basis as customers will be given the option to opt
        in or out of this additional support.\n\nRange of tasks to be carried out\n\u2022\tAssisting
        customers to undertake regular (possibly weekly) job searches \u2013 this
        could be internet based, phone based or from local press.\n\u2022\tSupporting
        customers to complete application forms for paid, volunteer or work experience
        opportunities.\n\u2022\tCarrying out mock interview practice with customers
        for paid, volunteer or work experience opportunities.\n\u2022\tHelping to
        instil a sense of belief and confidence in our customers by supporting them
        to see their potential, and ultimately gain employment.\n\u2022\tMeeting additional
        support needs that customers have to enable them to access our employment
        service \u2013 for example, this could include interpreting for someone who
        uses British Sign Language (BSL)\n\u2022\tCarrying out all of the above tasks
        with instruction and support from Scope\u2019s employment advisers.\n\nHow
        we will support you (including reasonable adjustments)\n\u2022\tVolunteer
        induction into Scope\n\u2022\tRelevant training (to be discussed on an individual
        basis)\n\u2022\tRegular meetings with your volunteer manager. \n\u2022\tWe

        you live anywhere in Harrow or near by, we would like to hear from you. We
        need volunteers who will visit a young person living in care once a month.
        Training given. CERTA accreditation available. \n\nEmail: volunteersouthern@sova.org.uk
        for more information or call direct on 0207 833 6740 \n\nWe are looking for
        adult (18+) volunteers who will visit a child or young person in foster care
        or living in a residential children''s home. Volunteer independent visitors
        are there to ''assist, befriend and advise'' and be a person in their lives
        who is separate from social services, and who spend time with the young person
        because they choose to. \n\nWe\u2019re delivering the Independent Visitor
        Service across Harrow. We match each volunteer independent visitor with a
        child or young person who needs extra support and encouragement, sometimes
        because they have little or no contact with their own families. \n\nThe volunteer
        is there as someone \u2018independent\u2019 in the young person\u2019s life,
        distinct from the professionals paid to support them. They might take the
        young person to the cinema or to the park, encourage them to try a new sport
        or hobby, support them at meetings or simply be there to talk to. It makes
        a real difference to a young person to know they have someone who is on their
        side, who has chosen to be there for them.\nAll of our volunteers are fully
        trained and supported and are asked to meet with their young person once a
        month for a couple of hours.\nWe normally ask for a minimum commitment for
        18 months to make a useful contribution to a young person''s life. There are
        opportunities throughout the week to volunteer on this project but, it is
        predominantly at the weekends.\n\nhttp://www.sova.org.uk/project/HarrowIV","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":80,"address_1":"5th

        As Action on Hearing Loss, we\u2019re working for a world where hearing loss
        doesn\u2019t limit or label people, where tinnitus is silenced and where people
        value and look after their hearing.\n\u2022\tWe provide day-to-day care for
        people who are deaf and have additional needs.\n\u2022\tWe supply communication
        services and training.\n\u2022\tWe offer practical advice to help people protect
        their hearing.\n\u2022\tWe campaign to change public policy around hearing
        loss issues.\n\u2022\tWe support research into an eventual cure for hearing
        loss and tinnitus.\n\nWhy we need you \n\nAs we enter our second century,
        we still urgently need to reach those with hearing loss, those at risk of
        losing their hearing, and those who do not realise how isolating hearing loss
        can be.","charity":true,"city":"London","contact_name":"Jane Bailey","created":"2014-10-27T12:20:20.561934+00:00","doit_approved":true,"donation_page":null,"email":"volunteering@hearingloss.org.uk","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/actiononhearingloss","id":"c503291a-df40-4928-a890-da8233262b67","instagram":null,"is_user_subscribed":false,"is_volunteer_center":false,"lat":50.37,"links":[{"href":"/v2/orgs/action-on-hearing-loss","title":"Action

        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store

        Please do not apply for this role via do-it.org, please apply in-store. If
        you are not sure where your nearest store is, please visit www.barnardos.org.uk/shopmap
        and enter your postcode to find out. If you would like to chat to a member
        of the team ahead of your visit you can find the store phone number by clicking
        on the shop icon on the map on our website.\r\n \r\nRunning a Barnardo''s
        Store needs a good team and you could be part of it! Our stores rely on a
        team of multi-skilled volunteers, from all walks of life who come together
        to generate vital funds for Barnardo''s work with children, young people and
        their families.\r\n \r\nUnlike standard retail outlets, our stores offer a
        fantastic opportunity to gain experience in all aspects of the retail operation.
        Our Stock Room Volunteers are trained to assist in a wide range of activities
        including: \r\n\r\nLooking through our donations to select and sort the quality
        stock for the shop floor. \r\nSorting and organising stock in the stockroom
        so that the area is kept in order. \r\nWorking behind the scenes to help to
        hang, size, steam and price stock. \r\nMaking sure all stock is safe and in
        working order.\r\n\r\nWe will provide you with all the support you need to
        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store
        manager and the rest of the team. Volunteering in a Barnardo''s charity shop
        allows you to gain new skills and meet new people whilst making a big difference
        to the lives of the children and young people Barnardo''s work with.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":451,"address_1":"Barnardo''s","address_2":"Tanners
