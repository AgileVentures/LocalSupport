        bit about this role</h3><p>Across Cats Protection there are thousands of cats
        and kittens needing temporary homes until they find their forever families.
        Many of our feline friends are cared for by volunteer fosterers in their homes
        or in purpose built pens in their gardens. Most of our volunteer fosterers
        care for one or two cats at a time, which makes a huge difference and gives
        these cats a second chance at a happy life. They provide vital hands on care
        and accommodation to stray, abandoned or injured cats and are part of a dedicated
        team of volunteers committed to finding new homes for cats in need.&nbsp;</p><h3>What
        can you expect to be doing?&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Meeting the needs of the cats
        in your care</li><li>Maintaining minimum veterinary and cat care standards</li><li>Cleaning
        and looking after the cats environment and equipment</li><li>Feeding, grooming
        and administering medication (such as flea and worm treatments)</li><li>Spending
        time enriching the cats experience in care including; play, exercise and stroking&nbsp;</li></ul><iframe

        frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><h3>What are the benefits
        to you and the cats?</h3><p>You will develop new skills, expand your knowledge
        and make a significant contribution to improving the lives of cats and kittens
        in need by caring for them before they find new loving homes. You will also
        meet new people, make new friends and be part of a dedicated team of volunteers.</p><h3>We&rsquo;re
        looking for someone with</h3><ul><li>Basic knowledge of cats and cat care</li><li>An
        appreciation of cat and hygiene standards</li><li>Good interpersonal skills</li><li>Patience,
        perseverance and empathy</li><li>Willingness to be part of a team&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Time
        expectation&nbsp;</h3><p>Our volunteer fosterers usually spend 3 to 5 hours
        per day in this role, but this might vary depending on the number of cats
        in care.&nbsp;</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><p>At Cats Protection we
        believe our volunteers should be happy and confident in their roles. To make
        sure this is the case, we provide support and guidance both remotely from
        our National Cat Centre and face to face through our regional and local volunteer
        groups and teams. We also offer varied online and face to face training and
        have wide-ranging policies covering all aspects of volunteering. We hope the
        support we provide will ensure our volunteers have a great experience with
        Cats Protection.</p>","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":75,"address_1":"National

        Trust is a youth- focused charity that is based in the Harrow area and works

        offers sports sessions, employment workshops, 1:1 mentoring, and access to

        are looking for females to help out at some of our projects which are focused
        on empowering girls from 13-25. Our main project in which girls attend is
        ''Expression'', which provides our young people with a chance to engage in
        fun activities, talk to our youth workers about any issues they are facing,
        and have a hot meal. We require a couple of female volunteers to attend these
        sessions and engage with our young girls by playing games, sports, and generally
        chatting to them. As we offer a hot meal at the end of the session, it would
        also be helpful if our volunteers could help out with the preparation and
        serving of the food.\n\nThis opportunity has been posted by Voluntary Action

        bit about this role</h3><p>Our vet link volunteers are the crucial link between
        local Cats Protection volunteer groups, teams and veterinary surgeries. They
        help build relationships, raise awareness of Cats Protection and promote our
        neutering schemes. This is a rewarding volunteer role as you will have a direct
        impact on helping cats in your local area by spreading the word about Cats
        Protection and how we help cats in need.&nbsp;</p><h3>What can you expect
        to be doing?&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Delivering literature and posters to veterinary
        surgeries</li><li>Keeping notice boards up to date</li><li>Informing veterinary
        surgeries about lost and found cats</li><li>Issuing new or monitoring existing
        donation boxes</li><li>Collecting and distributing donated food and goods
        from veterinary surgeries</li><li>Raising awareness of the financial help
        available through our neutering scheme&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>What are the benefits
        to you and the cats?</h3><p>You will develop new skills, expand your knowledge
        and make a significant contribution to improving the lives of cats and kittens
        by building and maintaining partnerships between Cats Protection and local
        veterinary surgeries. You will also meet new people, make new friends and
        be part of a dedicated team of volunteers.</p><h3>We&rsquo;re looking for
        someone with</h3><ul><li>Good interpersonal skills</li><li>Confidence in promoting
        Cats Protection activities</li><li>The ability to use initiative</li><li>Good
        organisation and time management skills</li><li>Confidence in handling money&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Time
        expectation&nbsp;</h3><p>Our vet link volunteers usually visit between 3 to
        5 veterinary surgeries per week in this role, which is flexible and can be
        shared by more than one volunteer if needed.&nbsp;</p><h3>Additional Information</h3><p>At
        Cats Protection we believe our volunteers should be happy and confident in
        their roles. To make sure this is the case, we provide support and guidance
        both remotely from our National Cat Centre and face to face through our regional
        and local volunteer groups and teams. We also offer varied online and face
        to face training and have wide-ranging policies covering all aspects of volunteering.

        people with bespoke advice and guidance, employability workshops, employment
        taster sessions, valuable work experience, interview preparation skills, and
        employment and training opportunities. \n\nMain purpose of the role \nIn this
        volunteer role as Volunteer Employment Support Assistant, you would be closely
        supporting the local employment advisers to offer either one to one or group
        support to customers that may fit our additional requirements. Your role would
        involve providing regular ad-hoc support to your allocated customer(s). Typical
        support may include interpretation (for example; BSL), literacy, job search
        and completing application forms, cover letters and engaging with customers
        to prepare them for both mock and work based interviews. The role is initially
        available on an ad-hoc basis as customers will be given the option to opt
        in or out of this additional support.\n\nRange of tasks to be carried out\n\u2022\tAssisting
        customers to undertake regular (possibly weekly) job searches \u2013 this
        could be internet based, phone based or from local press.\n\u2022\tSupporting
        customers to complete application forms for paid, volunteer or work experience
        opportunities.\n\u2022\tCarrying out mock interview practice with customers
        for paid, volunteer or work experience opportunities.\n\u2022\tHelping to
        instil a sense of belief and confidence in our customers by supporting them
        to see their potential, and ultimately gain employment.\n\u2022\tMeeting additional
        support needs that customers have to enable them to access our employment
        service \u2013 for example, this could include interpreting for someone who
        uses British Sign Language (BSL)\n\u2022\tCarrying out all of the above tasks
        with instruction and support from Scope\u2019s employment advisers.\n\nHow
        we will support you (including reasonable adjustments)\n\u2022\tVolunteer
        induction into Scope\n\u2022\tRelevant training (to be discussed on an individual
        basis)\n\u2022\tRegular meetings with your volunteer manager. \n\u2022\tWe
        will make accessibility adjustments to the role if required.\n\u2022\tReasonable
        travel expenses will be reimbursed.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":1,"address_1":"The

        a Marie Curie volunteer and help terminally ill people in your community.
        \n\nMarie Curie is looking for volunteers across London to look after collection
        tins and Daffodil boxes, placed in local shops. \n\nThe new coordinator will
        visit shops, every 6-12 weeks, to replace tins, checking they are correctly
        labelled, sealed and secured. \n\nThe contents will then need to be counted
        and banked. In February, the volunteer will place boxes of daffodil pins,
        in shops, to raise funds for the Great Daffodil Appeal- our flagship campaign.
        \n\nAll money raised will help Marie Curie provide extra care and support,
        so people with terminal illnesses and their families can get the most from
        the time they have left. \n\nThis flexible role can fit around your usual
        activities. Full training will be provided and volunteer registration will
        be required. \n\nEvery \u00a320 raised provides an hour of vital nursing care.

        stock for the shop floor. \r\nSorting and organising stock in the stockroom

        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store
        manager and the rest of the team. Volunteering in a Barnardo''s charity shop
        allows you to gain new skills and meet new people whilst making a big difference

        Please do not apply for this role via do-it.org, please apply in-store. If
        you are not sure where your nearest store is, please visit www.barnardos.org.uk/shopmap
        and enter your postcode to find out. If you would like to chat to a member
        of the team ahead of your visit you can find the store phone number by clicking
        on the shop icon on the map on our website.\r\n \r\nRunning a Barnardo''s
        Store needs a good team and you could be part of it! Our stores rely on a
        team of multi-skilled volunteers, from all walks of life who come together
        to generate vital funds for Barnardo''s work with children, young people and
        their families.\r\n \r\nUnlike standard retail outlets, our stores offer a
        fantastic opportunity to gain experience in all aspects of the retail operation.
        Our Stock Room Volunteers are trained to assist in a wide range of activities
        including: \r\n\r\nLooking through our donations to select and sort the quality
        stock for the shop floor. \r\nSorting and organising stock in the stockroom
        so that the area is kept in order. \r\nWorking behind the scenes to help to
        hang, size, steam and price stock. \r\nMaking sure all stock is safe and in
        working order.\r\n\r\nWe will provide you with all the support you need to
        feel confident in your role, with advice and training provided by your store
        manager and the rest of the team. Volunteering in a Barnardo''s charity shop
        allows you to gain new skills and meet new people whilst making a big difference
        to the lives of the children and young people Barnardo''s work with.","for_recruiter":{"active_opportunities_count":449,"address_1":"Barnardo''s","address_2":"Tanners
