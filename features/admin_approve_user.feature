Feature: Admin approve user
  As an Admin
  So that I can approve someone to be able to make edits for a particular charity
    (either by sending a verification e-mail to an e-mail address we know is
     connected to the relevant charity, when someone contacts us saying that
     this is his charity or when a new charity wants to be included on the database)
  I want to be able to verify the organisation/user and give them access to their charity.
