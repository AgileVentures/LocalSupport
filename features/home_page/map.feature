  Scenario: Show all charities on homepage map
    Given I visit the home page
    And I should see "Indian Elders Association", "Age UK" and "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" in the map centered on local organisations

  Scenario: Clickable hyperlinks to charity homepage in map
    Given I visit the home page
    And I should see hyperlinks for "Indian Elders Association", "Age UK" and "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" in the map

  Scenario: Changing address on the map changes the map coordinates
    Given I visit the home page
    Then the coordinates for "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" and "Youth UK" should not be the same
    And the coordinates for "Age UK" and "Youth UK" should be the same
    Given cookies are approved
    When I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Youth UK"
    And I update "Youth UK" charity address to be "34 pinner road"
    And I visit the home page
    Then the coordinates for "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" and "Youth UK" should be the same
    Then the coordinates for "Age UK" and "Youth UK" should not be the same
