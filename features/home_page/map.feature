  Scenario Outline: Organisation map has small icon for organisations updated more than 365 days ago
    Given I travel "<days>" days into the future
    And I visit the home page
    Then the organisation "Youth UK" should have a <size> icon
    Examples: 
      |days  | size |
      | 2    | large|
      |100   | large|
      |200   | large|
      |364   | large|
      |365   | small|
      |366   | small|
      |500   | small|

  @javascript
  Scenario: Organisation map has small icon for organisation with no users
    Given I visit the home page
    Then the organisation "Indian Elders Association" should have a small icon

  Scenario: Changing address on the map changes the map coordinates
    Given I visit the home page
    Then the coordinates for "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" and "Youth UK" should not be the same
    And the coordinates for "Age UK" and "Youth UK" should be the same
    Given cookies are approved
    When I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Youth UK"
    And I update "Youth UK" charity address to be "34 pinner road"
    And I visit the home page
    Then the coordinates for "Harrow Bereavement Counselling" and "Youth UK" should be the same
    Then the coordinates for "Age UK" and "Youth UK" should not be the same
