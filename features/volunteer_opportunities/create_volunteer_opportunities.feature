Feature: Org admin creating a volunteer work opportunity
  As an organisation admin
  So that I can recruit volunteers
  I would like to be able to add a volunteering opportunity to the system

  Background:
    Given the following organisations exist:
      | name     | description             | address        | postcode | telephone | website                     | email                      |
      | Friendly | Bereavement Counselling | 34 pinner road | HA1 4HZ  | 020800000 | http://friendly.example.org | admin@friendly.example.org |
      | Shy      | Software design         | 34 pinner road | HA1 1AA  | 020800001 | http://shy.example.org      | admin@shy.example.org      |

    And the following users are registered:
      | email                      | password | organisation | confirmed_at        | admin |
      | friend@harrowcn.org.uk     | pppppppp |              | 2007-01-01 10:00:00 | false |
      | admin@friendly.example.org | pppppppp | Friendly     | 2007-01-01 10:00:00 | false |

    And that the volunteer_ops_create flag is enabled
    And cookies are approved

  Scenario: Org-owners can see a Create Volunteer Opportunity button on their organisation show page
    Given I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Friendly"
    And I visit the show page for the organisation named "Friendly"
    And I click "Create a Volunteer Opportunity"
    Then I should be on the new volunteer opportunity page

  Scenario: Org-owner creating a volunteer opportunity
    Given I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Friendly"
    And I visit the new volunteer opportunity page
    And I should see "Create a new Volunteer Opportunity"
    And I submit an opportunity with title "Hard Work" and description "For no pay"
    Then I should be on the show page for the volunteer_op titled "Hard Work"
    And I should see "Hard Work"
    And I should see "For no pay"
    And I should see "Organisation: Friendly"

  Scenario: Org-owner creating a volunteer opportunity with invalid data

    And I should see "Title can't be blank"
    And I should see "Description can't be blank"

  Scenario: Signed in users who don't own the org cannot create volunteer opportunities on the sly
    Given I am signed in as an non-admin
    And I visit the new volunteer opportunity page
    Then I should see "You must be signed in as an organisation owner to perform this action!"

  Scenario: Only org-owners can create volunteer opportunities

    Given I visit the show page for the organisation named "Friendly"
    Then I should not see a link with text "Create a Volunteer Opportunity"

  Scenario: Signed in users who don't own the org cannot create volunteer opportunities

  Scenario: Org-owners can see a Create Volunteer Opportunity button on their organisation show page when feature is enabled
    And I am signed in as a charity worker related to "Shy"
    And I visit the show page for the organisation named "Shy"
