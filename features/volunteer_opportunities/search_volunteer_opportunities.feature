Feature: As a potential volunteer
  So that I can find an opportunity that interests me
  I would like to be able to search ops by keyword

  Background:
    Given the following organisations exist:
      | name                      | description          | address        | postcode | website       |

    And the following volunteer opportunities exist:
      | title              | description                                     | organisation              |

    And cookies are approved
    And I visit the volunteer opportunities page

  Scenario: Search a list of current volunteer opportunities by existing keywords
    Given I fill in "q" with "help" within the main body
    And I press "Search"
    Then I should see "Office Support"
    And I should not see "Litter Box Scooper" within "orgs_scroll"
    Then I should see 1 markers in the map
    And the map should show the opportunity titled Office Support

  Scenario: Search a list of current volunteer opportunities with a keyword that won't match
    Given I fill in "q" with "non existent text" within the main body
    And I press "Search"
    Then I should see "Sorry, it seems we don't have quite what you are looking for."

  Scenario: Query string is visible after search
    Given I fill in "q" with "search words" within the main body
    And I press "Search"
    Then the search box should contain "search words"
