Feature: List the upcoming events
  As a member of the public
  So that I can find out what's going on in my area
  I would like to see a list of the upcoming evens

  Background: Events have been added to the database

    Given the following events exist:
      | title          | description                        | postal   | start_date          | end_date            |
      | My first event | Good for everyone                  | HA1 4HZ  | 2030-10-20 10:30:14 | 2030-10-20 17:00:00 |
      | An Event today | Testing the calendar functionality | HA1 4HZ  | today               | today               |

  @javascript
  Scenario:
    Given I visit the events page
    Then I should see "My first event"
    And I should see "An Event today" within "calendar"
    And I should see "An Event today" within "events_scroll"
    And I should see "HA1 4HZ" within "postal code"
    And I should see "Start: Sunday, October 20, 2030 at 10:30"
    And I should see "End: Sunday, October 20, 2030 at 17:00"
