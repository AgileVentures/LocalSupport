Feature: Super Admin approve user
  As an Super Admin
  So that I can approve someone to be able to make edits for a particular charity
    (either by sending a verification e-mail to an e-mail address we know is
     connected to the relevant charity, when someone contacts us saying that
     this is his charity or when a new charity wants to be included on the database)
  I want to be able to verify the organisation/user and give them access to their charity.

  # this feature includes at least two components - the simple ability to approve a new charity superadmin
  # is described in "superadmin_approve_organisation_admin.feature"

  # sending out verification emails to an email address, handling new charity submissions is currently being worked on
  # TODO check which feature file this is going into
