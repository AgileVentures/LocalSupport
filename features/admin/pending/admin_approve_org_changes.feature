Feature: Site Super Admin approves a charity edit
  As an Super Admin
  So that I can approve someone else's changes to a charity
    (mainly for a newly registered organisation or an organisation
    who has asked to update their details but we have yet to
    approve them as a user for the site)
  I want to be alerted to the new details, be able to see the changes
    and approve / reject or contact the relevant organisation.
