Contributing to LocalSupport
===========================

So you'd like to contribute to the LocalSupport codebase?  That's wonderful, we're excited to have your help :-)

Please do come and say hello in our [Slack chat](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/localsupport). You can get an invite by signing up at [AgileVentures](https://www.agileventures.org) or emailing [info@agileventures.org](mailto:info@agileventures.org).  We have [weekly meetings](https://www.agileventures.org/events/localsupport-kick-off) to coordinate our efforts and we try to do planning poker voting on tickets before starting work on them.  Feel free to join any [AgileVentures daily scrum](https://www.agileventures.org/events/) to ask questions, to listen in, or just say hi :-)

Getting set up with the system on your local machine can be tricky depending on your platform and your devops skills.  We can provide prepared C9 instances if you want to get straight into the coding :-)

If you've already been here and have read through the document and are just looking for what is needed in a pull request to ensure that nothing is missed you can use this [contributing cheatsheet](https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/blob/develop/docs/CONTRIBUTING_CHEATSHEET.md).

Getting Started
---------------

Project work is organised via this Pivotal Tracker instance:

https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/742821

The `CURRENT` column is what people are currently working on - feel free to reach out to anyone working on those to see if they are interested in collaborating.

`BACKLOG` column tasks are ordered by priority (according to the client) and have 1, 2 or 3 points indicating difficulty (3 high). You are most welcome to start any task in the backlog, but please do come and say hi in our Slack channel:

https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/localsupport/

If the `CURRENT` and `BACKLOG` columns are mixed together for you, you can use the ... menu in Pivotal Tracker to split them up. See https://agileventures.slack.com/archives/C0KK907B5/p1510356098000090 for step-by-step instructions.

You can ask questions in the PT tickets themselves, or in the slack instance.  If you're not getting a response, please do tag `@tansaku` in the slack channel.  That's Sam Joseph, the project manager who'll be happy to help, or direct you to someone who can.

There's also the `ICEBOX` column where if you see something interesting you want to work on you can start on that.  However please do ensure it has an estimate.  If it does not then please coordinate with the ProjectManager to get the story voted on to create an estimate.  This helps you get input on what it would take to get the story done as well as helping the team understand what it is you want to work on.

It's also great to look through the current PRs to see what code people are submitting:

https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/pulls

Leaving comments and +1s where appropriate.  For more general details on joining any AgileVentures project please see:

Development Process
------------------

If you start working on something selected from Pivotal Tracker, please click "start" to indicate to others that you are working on the ticket so that others don't accidentally start in parallel without checking in with you.

Our default working branch on Github is `develop`.  We do work by creating branches off `develop` for new features and bugfixes.  Any feature should include appropriate Cucumber acceptance tests and RSpec unit tests.  We try to avoid view and controller specs, and focus purely on unit tests at the model and service level where possible.  A bugfix may include an acceptance test depending on where the bug occurred, but fixing a bug should start with the creation of a test that replicates the bug, so that any bugfix submission will include an appropriate test as well as the fix itself.


Each developer will usually work with a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the [main repository on Agile Ventures](https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport). Before starting work on a new feature or bugfix, please ensure you have [synced your fork to upstream/develop](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/):

```
git pull upstream develop
```

Note you may need to run the following command before syncing with the upstream/develop.

If you are using SSH
```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:AgileVentures/LocalSupport.git
```
If you are using  HTTPS
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport.git
```

Note that you should be re-syncing daily (even hourly at very active times) on your feature/bugfix branch to ensure that you are always building on top of very latest develop code.

We use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/742821) to manage our work on features, chores and bugfixes, and we have an [integrated Pivotal/GitHub workflow](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-labs/labs/level-up-your-development-workflow-with-github-pivotal-tracker) that requires the following procedures:

Please create feature/bug-fix branches that include the id of the relevant pivotal tracker ticket, e.g.

```
git checkout -b 112900047_make_capybara_wait_for_javascript_element
```

Please ensure that each commit in your pull request makes a single coherent change and that the overall pull request only includes commits related to the specific GitHub issue that the pull request is addressing.  This helps the project managers understand the PRs and merge them more quickly.

This is a learning project and so we currently do NOT require developers to rebase their work into a single commit - in particular because this interferes with the history of comments in the pull request.

Whatever you are working on, or however far you get please open a "Work in Progress" (WIP) [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) so that others in the team can comment on your approach.  Even if you hate your horrible code :-) please throw it up there; you'll get automated feedback on code style from [hound](https://houndci.com/) and we'll help guide your code to fit in with the rest of the project.

### Pull Requests

Please ensure that your pull request description has a hyperlink to the Pivotal Tracker ticket that it corresponds to, to allow anyone to quickly jump to a description of the story, bug or chore that the pull-request is addressing.  Where possible please do add a couple of sentences explaining the approach taken in the pull request.  This is an example of a good PR with a good description:

https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/pull/418

### Git Comments

On your final git commit please include a comment in this format:

```
makes Capybara check for visibility more robust [Finishes #112900047]
```

which will close the relevant Pivotal Tracker ticket when we merge in your pull-request.   The idea is that the ticket is finished when the team has reviewed and merged the PR, not at the point that the individual developer thinks they are first finished with the ticket.

Please also place a hyperlink to the relevant Pivotal Tracker ticket in the pull request description so that anyone reviewing the ticket can click straight through to the tracker ticket, e.g.

![place a hyperlink to the Pivotal ticket in the PR description](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/cy3j384kigpkxxg/Screenshot%202019-03-07%2014.45.06.png?dl=0)

### Delivering and Accepting

If your git comments have included the correct syntax the corresponding pivotal tracker ticket should be marked as "finished" when the pull request is merged.  If this fails we may need to manually mark the ticket as finished, but it should never be marked as "finished" until the PR is merged.  After it is merged and the ticket is "finished", it will be "delivered" when it is deployed to the production system, so there's never any need for anyone besides the person doing the deploy to click "delivered".  Finally the client is the one who signs off on whether a ticket is "accepted", or in cases of chores/bugs that the client is unclear on it is the project manager.

Code Style
-------------

We follow the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) configured according to https://github.com/AgileVentures/LocalSupport/blob/develop/.rubocop.yml

[Hound](http://houndci.com) inserts style suggestions into pull requests and you can see these in advance by either:

1. Configuring your own fork of LocalSupport with Hound OR
2. Running rubocop from the command line on your diff: https://github.com/m4i/rubocop-git


Feature Flags
-------------

We use Feature Flags to allow a feature to be turned off and on at will.  This allows us to deploy the code to production and check for side effects, before we actually make it available to end users.  We can then enable it at a precise time of our choosing (since merges to develop, staging and master are auto-deployed to each of http://develop.harrowcn.org.uk, http://staging.harrowcn.org.uk and http://harrowcn.org.uk), and can also switch the feature off just as easily if problems occur.

Please ask for advice on whether a feature you are working on requires a feature flag.  If you do set up a new [Feature Flag (or 'toggle')](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) please ensure to:

1) Add a migration to place that feature flag in the database, e.g.

```
class AddSearchInputBarOnOrgPages < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    Feature.create(name: :search_input_bar_on_org_pages)
  end

  def down
    Feature.find_by(name: :search_input_bar_on_org_pages).destroy
  end
end
```

2) Activate the feature in `db/seeds.rb` file like so:

```
Feature.activate('search_input_bar_on_org_pages')
```

So that new developers will be set up with the activated features when they first check out a copy of the project and run `rake db:seed`

Acceptance Testing & Caching
----------------------------

Our Acceptance (or feature) tests are written in Cucumber to use a high level language that is as close as possible to the specifications provided by the client.

Our Acceptance tests are sandboxed against network connections with VCR and Puffing Billy and we use poltergeist as a JavaScript driver for those tests that involve JavaScript functionality on the front end.  Poltergeist uses PhantomJS under the hood and we use the phantomjs gem to fix a particular version of PhantomJS.  If you have PhantomJS installed globally you may want to remove it to ensure the correct version of PhantomJS is in use during the running of the Acceptance tests.

We have several challenges with the current acceptance tests.  One is that some of the javascript tests fail intermittently, particularly on CI.  Partly in an attempt to address this issue we added comprehensive [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) and [PuffingBilly](https://github.com/oesmith/puffing-billy) sandboxing of network interactions in the acceptance tests.  While these caches allow some of our tests to run faster, and avoid us hitting third party services, they can be very confusing to develop against.

The principle is that one should avoid having tests depend on 3rd party systems over the network, and that we shouldn't spam 3rd party remote services with our test runs.  However the reality is more complicated.  For example in talking to some 3rd party organisations, they've said that they are happy to support test run hits "within reason".  Also, a cached network interaction can make it seem like a part of the system is working, when in fact it will fail in production due to a real change to the network service.  The action here should be to delete the relevant cache files, re-run, save the new cache files (which VCR and PuffingBilly should handle for us) and then commit the new cache files to git.

The reality is that it is often difficult to work out which are the relevant cache files (particularly if you're new to the project) and it's easy to mis-understand what's happening with the caches.  A common reaction to seeing lots of cache files (files in `features/req_cache/` and `features/vcr_cassettes/`) when you run `git status` is to add them to `.gitignore` (which happened on LocalSupport and caused lots of confusion) or simply delete them.

There's a Gordian Knot here which is that we'd like it that if a tests passes on your machine, then it should pass on my machine.  However, if the test relies on a 3rd party network service, then all bets are off.  With some reliable network services that's not such a big deal, but it can be very confusing.  If we just add the cache files to `.gitignore` we can get into some very confusing situations where developers don't realise they are running against cached network interactions.  We provide a rake task that deletes the cache files and checks them out again:

  ```
  rake vcr_billy_caches:reset
  ```

  but you still might be confused about which cache files you should be checking in with your tests.

In the ideal world the `develop` branch would run green for you and there would be no extraneous files.  Then you add your new test and it's implementation.  Once it's all working you will likely have a bunch of cache files.  These should be deleted in the first instance since some may be due to erroneous network interactions as you were developing.  Assuming you have got to a reliable green test stage you can clean up (`rm -rf features/req_cache/` and `rm-rf features/vcr_cassettes/` and `git checkout features/req_cache/` and `git checkout features/vcr_cassettes`) and then re-run.  At this point, if you got another complete green run (for safety just run your new tests) any new cache files are associated with your tests, and these should be checked in to ensure that your new test/functionality will run the same everywhere.

However the above is complicated and we are actively looking for some sort of testing solution that allows us to avoid the intermittent failing tests (maybe we need to upgrade capybara) and maybe dropping the whole caching approach is one way forward.  Please jump in our [Slack channel](https://agileventures.slack.com/messages/C0KK907B5/details/) and let us know what you think :-)

Code Climate
------------

Code Climate does automated review of our pull requests.  They are automated so they are not to be taken too seriously.  They are hints and reminders about code quality.  If you can fix the issues raised that's great, although sometimes you won't have time.  If you have Code Climate issues on your pull request that you can't or won't have time to fix and you'd like to get it merged, please open "refactoring" chores on Pivotal Tracker - one per code climate issue.  Then link those tracker tickets into your pull request to show that you've taken then step.
